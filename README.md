## Overview

The Age Calculator App challenge pushed my JavaScript skills to the next level. It's a simple web app that takes a birthdate as input and calculates the user's age. The project allowed me to explore working with the Date object, implement user input validation, and dynamically adjust the app's behavior based on different scenarios.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I Learned

- **Working with the Date Object in JavaScript:** Explored how to effectively use the Date object for handling date-related functionalities.
- **User Input Validation:** Learned techniques for validating user input and dynamically adjusting the app's behavior accordingly.

### Continued Development

I look forward to diving deeper into JavaScript and exploring more interesting concepts and functionalities. As I continue to grow, I plan to expand my knowledge and apply it to future projects.
